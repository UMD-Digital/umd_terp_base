- Minor versions (non breaking changes): 8.1.1, 8.1.2, etc.
- Major versions (breaking changes): 8.2.0, 8.3.0, etc.

### Core (base) module issues, patches, etc

All edits, requests, etc should be submitted to the github repo for the [UMD Terp Base Module](https://github.com/UMD-Digital/umd_terp_base). Please add issues to the [issues queue](https://github.com/UMD-Digital/umd_terp_base/issues). Patches will be reviewed on a merit and resources available basis.

### Frontend

All CSS, JS, etc are based in the [UMD Terp Theme](https://github.com/UMD-Digital/umd_terp). This module contains no frontend styles for any widgets/etc.

### Customization

- THIS MODULE SHOULD NEVER BE MODIFIED DIRECTLY.
- All customizations should go into a custom module.

All Configuration for each module is created on install. Technically, you can modify these, though we do not reccomend it. Any future updates for modules will come with a hook to re-install config for that module, so better to leave any existing module config as is. Changes to existing configuration are better done via form_alter hooks, leaving default config in place.

#### Nodes

Use `hook_form_alter()`. For example, to remove the "Hide sidebar" boolean from themes that do not need it, in YOUR_CUSTOM_MODULE do the following:

```php
function YOUR_CUSTOM_MODULE_form_alter(&$form, FormStateInterface $form_state, $form_id) {
  // Hide the sidebar boolean.
  if ($form_id == 'node_umd_terp_basic_page_form' || $form_id = 'node_umd_terp_basic_page_edit_form') {
    if ( isset($form['field_umdt_ct_hide_sidebar'])) {
      $form['field_umdt_ct_hide_sidebar']['#access'] = FALSE;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Paragraphs

Use `hook_field_WIDGET_TYPE_paragraphs_form_alter()`. For example, to remove the "style (light or dark) from a theme that does not need/want it, in YOUR_CUSTOM_MODULE do the following:

```php
function YOUR_CUSTOM_MODULE_field_widget_paragraphs_form_alter(&$element, &$form_state, $context) {
  // Remove light/dark choice from UT Blockquote.
  if ($element['#paragraph_type'] == 'ut_blockquote') {
    if (isset($element['subform']['field_ut_blockquote_style'])) {
      $element['subform']['field_ut_blockquote_style']['#access'] = FALSE;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Markup/Hook Overrides

- You may override paragraphs templates by copying them into the sub-theme theme folder.
- You may override hooks by copying into sub-theme .theme, or custom module .module and modifying hook name/etc.
